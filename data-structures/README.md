***Lab 05 Linked Lists***

**Node Class:**
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node and a pointer to the next Node.

**Empty List:**
Within your LinkedList class include a head property. Upon instantiation an empty Linked List should be created.

**Insert:**
Define a method called insert which takes a value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

**Includes:**
Define a method called includes which takes a value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

**Print:**
Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection of all the current Node values in the Linked List.
