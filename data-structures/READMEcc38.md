# Challenge Summary
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge Description
Write a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in Java methods, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.
